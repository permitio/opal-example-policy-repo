OPAL Example Policy Repo
</h2>

[Check out OPAL main repo here.](https://github.com/permitio/opal)

### What's in this repo?
This repo contain an example git repo containing a basic [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) policy written in [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#what-is-rego).

This repo is used in [OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal)'s Getting Started [tutorial](https://opal.ac/getting-started/quickstart/docker-compose-config/overview) to **demonstrate** how OPAL keeps your OPA agents in sync with policy and data changes. When commits are affecting this repo, the OPAL server will immediately push updates (over websockets pub/sub interface) to the connected OPAL clients, and they in turn will push the updated policy and data to OPA.

If you follow [the tutorial](https://opal.ac/getting-started/quickstart/docker-compose-config/overview), you will see how this repo is used by OPAL in a real example running in docker-compose. The entire tutorial is also available as [video](https://asciinema.org/a/5IMzZRPltUiFdsNnZ81t14ERk?t=1).

#### The policy in this repo
This repo has a very simple [RBAC policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control):
- each user is granted certain roles
- a user can perform an action on a resource, only if:
  - one of his roles has permission to do so
  - the user "location" is in the US (a special **twist** that is **non-standard** to RBAC, but is useful for the tutorial)
- a user with admin role can do anything

### About OPA (Open Policy Agent)

#### Why use OPA?
OPA enables decoupling policy from code in your applications, and enables you to evolve your application and your authorization policies (i.e: "permissions logic") separately.

#### Who uses OPA?
Companies like [Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6tUNpRpdnY) and [Pinterest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhgxFICWsA8) built their authorization layer using OPA

### About OPAL (Open Policy Administration Layer)
[OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal) is an administration layer for Open Policy Agent (OPA), detecting changes to both policy and policy data in realtime and pushing live updates to your agents.

OPAL brings open-policy up to the speed needed by live applications. As your application state changes (whether it's via your APIs, DBs, git, S3 or 3rd-party SaaS services), OPAL will make sure your services are always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need (and only those they need).
